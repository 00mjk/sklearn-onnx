What is the opset number?
=========================

.. index:: opset, target opset, version

Every library is versioned. :epkg:`scikit-learn` may change
the implementation of a specific model. That happens
for example with the `SVC <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html>`_ model where
the parameter *break_ties* was added in 0.22. :epkg:`ONNX`
does also have a version called *opset number*.
Operator *ArgMin* was added in opset 1 and changed in opset
11, 12, 13. Sometimes, it is updated to extend the list
of types it supports, sometimes, it moves a parameter
into the input list. The runtime used to deploy the model
does not implement a new version, in that case, a model
must be converted by usually using the most recent opset
supported by the runtime, we call that opset the
*targeted opset*. An ONNX graph only contains
one unique opset, every node must be described following
the specifications defined by the latest opset below the
targeted opset.

This example considers an `IsolationForest
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/
sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html>`_ and digs into opsets.

                dim_value: 1
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    opset_import {
      domain: "ai.onnx.ml"
      version: 2
    }
    opset_import {
      domain: ""
      version: 12
    }





The last line shows the opsets.
Let's extract it.


.. code-block:: default


    domains = onx.opset_import
    for dom in domains:
        print("domain: %r, version: %r" % (dom.domain, dom.version))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    domain: 'ai.onnx.ml', version: 2
    domain: '', version: 12




There are two opsets, one for standard operators,
the other for machine learning operators.

ONNX and opset
++++++++++++++

The converter can convert a model to an older opset
than the default one, from 1 to the last available one.


.. code-block:: default



    def get_domain_opset(onx):
        domains = onx.opset_import
        res = [{'domain': dom.domain, 'version': dom.version}
               for dom in domains]
        return {d['domain']: d['version'] for d in res}


    for opset in range(1, onnx_opset_version() + 1):
        try:
            onx = to_onnx(model, X[:1].astype(numpy.float32), target_opset=opset)
        except RuntimeError as e:
            print('target: %r error: %r' % (opset, e))
            continue
        nodes = len(onx.graph.node)
        print('target: %r --> %s %d' % (opset, get_domain_opset(onx), nodes))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    target: 1 error: RuntimeError("Operator 'Reshape' expects a number of inputs in [1, 1] not 2")
    target: 2 error: RuntimeError("Operator 'Reshape' expects a number of inputs in [1, 1] not 2")
    target: 3 error: RuntimeError("Operator 'Reshape' expects a number of inputs in [1, 1] not 2")
    target: 4 error: RuntimeError("Operator 'Reshape' expects a number of inputs in [1, 1] not 2")
    target: 5 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 5} 91
    target: 6 --> {'': 6, 'ai.onnx.ml': 2} 91
    target: 7 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 7} 91
    target: 8 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 8} 91
    target: 9 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 9} 91
    target: 10 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 10} 91
    target: 11 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 11} 91
    target: 12 --> {'ai.onnx.ml': 2, '': 12} 91




It shows that the model cannot be converted for opset
below 5. Operator `Reshape <https://github.com/onnx/
onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#Reshape>`_ changed in
opset 5: a parameter became an input. The converter
does not support *opset < 5* because runtimes usually do not.

Other opsets
++++++++++++

The previous example changed the opset of the main domain
``''`` but the other opset domain can be changed as well.


.. code-block:: default


    for opset in range(9, onnx_opset_version() + 1):
        for opset_ml in range(1, 3):
            tops = {'': opset, 'ai.onnx.ml': opset_ml}
            try:
                onx = to_onnx(
                    model, X[:1].astype(numpy.float32), target_opset=tops)
            except RuntimeError as e:
                print('target: %r error: %r' % (opset, e))
                continue
            nodes = len(onx.graph.node)
            print('target: %r --> %s %d' % (opset, get_domain_opset(onx), nodes))
